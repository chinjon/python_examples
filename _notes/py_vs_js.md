# Python vs. JavaScript

Document outlines personal findings of the differences between languages as a JavaScript developer.

## Basics

### Boolean

In `python` `True` and `False` are formatted with capitol letters.
In `javascript` they are lower case, `true`, `false` (??)

### Syntax

In `javascript`, `semicolons` are optional syntax items that signal to developers that it is the end of a statement. This is total optional due to [automatic semicolon injection](https://flaviocopes.com/javascript-automatic-semicolon-insertion/).
